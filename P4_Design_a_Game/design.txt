What additional properties did you add to your models and why?

1. Added move_histories in Game object. A history of recorded input sequences was creted as a pickle property. This enables users to easily query their previous moved using the get_game_history endpoint.

2. Added a check_answer property to store the user's progress throughout the game. Each game consists of guessing a string of characters that make a word. The check_answer stores all correct guesses at the exact indexes of the word's characters. This can be used to check against duplicates and wrong attempts.

3. Modified reminder emails Only send emails to users who have a game in-progress every 12 hours.

What were some of the trade-offs or struggles you faced when implementing the new game logic?

It was very difficult to understand how google app engine fit in this game design beyond the conference app project. But I was able to understand enough to get a simple game app going.

On a more practical note, validating inputs and showing progress was a fair bit of struggle. Earlier versions of the hangman app seemed prone to common input errors, like double entries and duplicate entries. I solved these by creating appropriate validations, including a regular expression match. Communicating progress to the user was the second hurdle I faced. I over came this with the notion of breaking up a word into individual characters ordered by their indexes in the latter word.
